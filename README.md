# Gesture recognition 
This project implements a deep learning-based system for hand gesture recognition using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The system is capable of recognizing seven different hand gestures and controlling media playback functions like play/pause, volume control, and track navigation based on the recognized gestures.

**Overview**
The project involves three major steps:
Data Collection: Capturing hand gesture images to build a training dataset.
Training the CNN Model: Building and training a Convolutional Neural Network using the captured images.
Gesture Prediction and Media Control: Using the trained model to recognize hand gestures and control media playback.
Features

**Challenges and Solutions**

Data Collection and Preparation

Challenge: Collecting a sufficient and diverse dataset of hand gestures to train the model effectively. Capturing images with consistent lighting, positioning, and background proved difficult, affecting the model's accuracy.

Solution: A custom dataset was created by capturing images in a controlled environment using a webcam. The images were organized into categories and augmented using techniques like flipping, zooming, and shearing to increase the dataset's diversity and improve the model's generalization.

Real-time Gesture Recognition

Challenge: Processing video frames in real-time while maintaining accurate gesture recognition was challenging due to the computational complexity of the CNN model.

Solution: The model was optimized by resizing input frames and converting them to grayscale, reducing the computational load. Additionally, the system was implemented using OpenCV, which efficiently handles real-time video processing.

Model Overfitting

Challenge: The model was prone to overfitting, especially given the relatively small dataset, leading to high training accuracy but poor performance on unseen data.

Solution: Regularization techniques, such as dropout, and data augmentation were used to reduce overfitting. The model's architecture was carefully designed with appropriate layers and activation functions to balance complexity and performance.

Gesture Misclassification

Challenge: The system occasionally misclassified gestures, especially those with similar visual features, leading to incorrect media control actions.

Solution: The CNN model was fine-tuned by experimenting with different hyperparameters and increasing the number of training epochs. Additionally, the prediction results were post-processed by implementing a majority voting mechanism over a few frames to improve the robustness of gesture recognition.
